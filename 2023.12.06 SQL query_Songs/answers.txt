1. If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

I calculated the average energy as 0.65906, valence as 0.484443, and danceability as 0.71646 of this person's top 100 songs. Based on what I found, combined with the audio aura
descriptors from Spotify, I would estimate this person to be happy and passionate or a Pink and a Purple aura.


2. Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

I'm not sure basing what a person listens to based on energy, valence, and danceability is a good way to get to know them or would be very representative of them as a person.
Only what they listened to. You don't know the why behind their musical choices. There is a lot to take into consideration when determining what is representative of one listener
and why they chose to listen to what they listen to.

Rather than look at the top songs based on those three categories, I would look at how much they've listened to particular music or an artist, or how much acoustic,
electric, jazz, rock, pop, and etc do they listen to. I would factor in the percentage of streams of their musical choices using more categories over all the music they streamed.
If they tend to listen more to a particular genre or artist, over others, it would better determine their mood or aura for the year.
