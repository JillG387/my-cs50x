Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The smaller the number of simulations, the shorter the processing time. I had expected this to happen.
However, I also expected the predictions to change but they did not. Only their percentages.


Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

After 1000 simulations, the predictions seemed to steady out with only minor point changes.
I think 1000 simulations is a good number. The results were good with minor waiting time.
Although, if the desired result is to get paid more for a longer compute time, going with 1000000 simulations is a desirable number.
